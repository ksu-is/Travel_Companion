# Travel Companion for US to Metric unit conversions

## Objective
Create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based application that helps travelers with unit conversions between US measuring system and the International metric system. 

## Purpose
Most of the existing conversion utilities are very complicated to use and they offer too many conversion choices which, for the average traveler is unnecessary. Most travelers are interested in simple temperature conversion, distance conversion, volume conversion, weight conversion, and length conversion.

Tkinter is used for the Graphical User Interface, and Python code in the CalcGUI application are used to create the Travel Companion App. New buttons are added for the different conversions without overwhelming the user and simplifying their experience. Users can enter the number and click on the desired conversion without doing anything else. Each button has its own associated conversion function in Python. 

The Travel Companion Application also provides basic calculator functions to aid the Traveler.
